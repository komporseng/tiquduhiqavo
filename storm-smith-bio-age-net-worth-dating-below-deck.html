And this time, under the captainship of Sandy Yawn, there appeared a brand new set of skilled yachties which included our star, Storm Smith.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, not everyone was a new face. Returning this season with even more experience also was Mzi “Zee” Dempers — Storm’s childhood friend. Perhaps, it was Mzi who influenced&nbsp; Storm into coming to the show?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As a deckhand, Storm promised to use his abundance of knowledge from his time on a handful of different boats, and meet the exceptionally high standards and demands of the yachting industry. Also, given his defense mechanism to make light of the situation,&nbsp; the star didn’t mind the dramas. However, he didn’t have an issue taking hold of the ropes when things got out of hand either.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>At the time of writing this article, Storm had already graced 2 eps of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Below Deck Mediterranean</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> — the first ep title “There’s No Place Like Home,” and the second “ I’ve Got a Sea-cret.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Storm for the 7th installment of the show were his co-stars — Chief Stew Natasha Webb, Chef Dave White, Bosun Raygan Tyler, Stew Kyle Viljoen, Deckhand Mzi “Zee” Dempers, and Deckhand Jason Gaskell.</span></p><h3><b>Storm Smith Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Storm Smith flaunted a net worth of above $400 thousand in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This “modern pirate” fell in love with boating at a young age.
