Is It Cake? is more about making cakes that look like other things.</p><p>Nine amazing cake artists are brought in to assemble hyper-realistic cakes that look like everyday items in the hopes of fooling the judges each round. Nina Maria Charles, whom we are going to talk about in the rest of this writing is one of them.</p><h3><strong>Nina Maria Charles O</strong><strong>n Netflix’s Is It Cake?</strong></h3><p>Being on TV was never a goal for baker Nina Maria Charles going into the year, but she was for sure excited when approached with the opportunity.</p><p>The filming of&nbsp;Is It Cake? lasted about four weeks and she felt blessed to be able to put her amazing cakes on display on such a great platform. (Of course) she was elated to meet an actor from her favorite show.

But it turned out to be an “absolute disaster”.</p><p>Embarrassed Nina felt like she was going to redeem herself the next year. She decided to study and figure out how to do fondant cakes and all “other stuff” in baking.</p><p>So, when a Snoopy cake came out amazing, she posted it and everybody started asking and it became a business, which now has the name of Nina Bakes Cakes.</p><p>Her cake business offers a variety of desserts including wedding cakes, tasting boxes, cookies, decorated cakes, cake bouquets, cake bowls, and hyper-realistic cakes. Also, when Charles is not baking she runs her food truck Nina Creole, known for the creole eggrolls and lobster corndogs.</p><p>As netflix.com puts it, with her Louisiana-inspired bakes, Nina always makes sure to pay homage to her hometown.
