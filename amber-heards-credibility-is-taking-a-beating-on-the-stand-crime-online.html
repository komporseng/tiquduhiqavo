In testimony this week, Heard said her op-ed about domestic violence in the Washington Post in 2018 — the source behind Depp’s $50 million lawsuit against her, although it doesn’t mention his name — was not about her actor ex-husband at all."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Amber Heards Credibility Is Taking a Beating on the Stand Crime Online</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Neither Amber Heard nor Johnny Depp are doing themselves any favors in the defamation trial between them, CrimeOnline’s Nancy Grace says.</p><p>Heard’s “credibility is taking a beating,” Grace said on Fox New Tuesday, “and that’s her fault.”</p><p>In testimony this week, Heard said her op-ed about domestic violence in the Washington Post in 2018 — the source behind Depp’s $50 million lawsuit against her, although it doesn’t mention his name — was not about her actor ex-husband at all.</p><p></p><p>“Do they think the jury’s stupid?” Grace said, noting testimony earlier in which Heard reportedly urged that Depp’s name be used in the article.</p><p>“That just happened,” she said. “I remember it. Certain the jury remembers it.”</p><p>Other testimony, Grace noted, as shown that Heard lied under other about $7 million in donations she had pledged to make from her divorce settlement.</p><p>“Does that mean she’s not a domestic violence victim? No, but it shows she lied under oath.”</p><p>“What she’s saying now is not gelling with the other testimony, and that is a problem for Amber Heard [and] her credibility,” Grace said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/co-a2.freetls.fastly.net/co-uploads/2022/05/AP22136696282448.jpg><p>Grace referred back to the infamous “dog poop” incident in which Depp found feces in the bed and believed Heard had left the deposit.</p><p>“We know she told a chauffeur it was a prank,” she said. “So now she’s blaming the dog? How far can that go to blame the dog, like the dog’s gonna take the stand to refute it?”</p><p>Grace also wondered why Heard hadn’t called her make-up people “to testify about all the bruising,” even though she’s mentioned them on the stand.</p><p>“As it stands right now, she’s losing ground, and this is her time to shine,” she said.</p><p>But Grace had harsh words for Depp as well.</p><p>“Depp better get ahold of himself, because he’s smirking and smiling, laughing,” she said. “The jury is not that group of people, his groupies, outside the courthouse. He needs to become much more serious in front of this jury and not let it look like it’s ‘Beavis and Butthead’ over there at his table. That is not looking good for him.”</p><p>In the end, Grace said, the jury has to decide which side in this case has swayed them.</p><p>“With a civil case, it’s the bare minimum,” she said. “If you believe one side just a little more than the other side, that’s how you find, as opposed to a criminal case where it’s beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.</strong></p><p>[Featured image: Nancy Grace/Fox News screenshot]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5a6o7HRZp%2BemaKZwG6v0Z6bopqZoba1xYyiqmaskaC2r7OMmmSbnZGptq%2BzjKilZqyYmnq0wMCnm2abop66pnnOp6OippVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-landfill-by-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Landfill by Daughter</span></a>
