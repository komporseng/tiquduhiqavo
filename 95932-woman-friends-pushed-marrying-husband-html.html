Thanks to his friends, he now has a wife.</p><p class=align-left>The Ugandan national and his wife Rita Masika started dating six years after they met through mutual friends.</p><p class=align-left>It all started during a get-together. The two saw each other for the first time but did not really have any kind of interaction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/cae00c95f50b0134.jpg><p class=align-left>Then they bumped into one another at a church event and even then, not much materialised from their reunion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/3322f44188c8dc7f.jpg><p class=align-left>But later on, during a wedding, cupid worked its wonders and Rita’s friends suggested that maybe she deserved to be with a man like Joard.</p><p class=align-left>And as fate would have it, Joard’s friends gave him Rita’s number. That is when the sparks started flying.</p>“When he called me in July, his line was, ‘I saw you somewhere.’ I thought he was one of those unserious boys that used to call me. I had just ended a relationship and needed time alone,” Rita told Mywedding.co.ug.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/6f9dbd9f68794dda.jpg><p class=align-left>At first, Rita resorted to ignoring her prince charming’s calls because she found him to be a joker who would end up wasting her time.</p><p class=align-left>Joard did better and managed to track his mystery woman down again.</p><p class=align-left>The two officially met in 2018 but Joard’s dressing did not impress Rita. They met again in January 2019 and that is when her heart melted.</p><p class=align-left>She started feeling butterflies in her tummy and her head would go faint whenever she thought of her new catch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/285084db73a7d789.jpg>“I missed him and if he did not call, I would call,” the happy wife narrated.<p class=align-left>Finally, in November 2019, Joard visited Ritah’s parents and the two slotted their white wedding for February 2021.</p><p class=align-left>They walked down the aisle in a colourful ceremony surrounded by friends and family. All they hope for now is a happily ever after.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
