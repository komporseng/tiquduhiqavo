Card grading is a process that involves evaluating the condition of a sports card and assigning it a grade, which helps collectors determine its worth. But with so many grading companies out there, who is the most reliable?</p><span></span><p>One of the most well-known grading companies is Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA). PSA has been around since 1991 and is considered the gold standard in the industry. They use a 10-point grading scale, with 10 being the highest grade a card can receive. PSA's grading process is thorough and consistent, which is why their grades carry so much weight in the collecting community.</p><span></span><p>Another popular grading company is Beckett Grading Services (BGS). BGS has been around since 1999 and is known for their subgrades, which allow collectors to see how each aspect of the card was graded. BGS also uses a 10-point grading scale, but their grades are slightly different from PSA's. BGS's grading process is also very reliable, and their grades are respected in the collecting community.</p><span></span><p>Sportscard Guaranty (SGC) is another grading company that has been gaining popularity in recent years. SGC has been around since 1998 and uses a 100-point grading scale, with 100 being the highest grade a card can receive. SGC's grading process is also very thorough, and their grades are considered reliable by many collectors.</p><span></span><p>One of the newer grading companies is Certified Guaranty Company (CGC), which started grading sports cards in 2020. CGC is known for their expertise in grading comic books, and they bring that same level of professionalism to grading sports cards. CGC uses a 10-point grading scale and their grades are respected by many collectors, even though they are a newer company.</p><span></span><p>So, who is the most reliable grading company? The answer is subjective and depends on who you ask. However, PSA is generally considered the most reliable grading company by the majority of collectors. PSA's grading process is consistent, and their grades are widely accepted in the collecting community. While BGS and SGC are also respected grading companies, PSA is often considered the gold standard.</p><span></span><p>It's important to note that grading companies do make mistakes and there have been instances of cards being misgraded. However, reputable grading companies will stand behind their grades and will work with collectors to resolve any issues.</p><span></span><p>In conclusion, when it comes to card grading, it's important to do your research and choose a reliable grading company. PSA, BGS, SGC, and CGC are all respected grading companies, but PSA is generally considered the most reliable by the majority of collectors. Ultimately, the value of a sports card comes down to its condition, and a reliable grading company can help determine that condition and give collectors an accurate idea of its worth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlmah6tbTEZqSoq6Riv6a4yJqZpZ1dmK6zsIygqZqcmaO0bq%2FOpqeapqk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-kiss-the-dirt-falling-down-the-mountain-by-inxs.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Kiss The Dirt (Falling Down The Mountain) by INXS</span></a>
