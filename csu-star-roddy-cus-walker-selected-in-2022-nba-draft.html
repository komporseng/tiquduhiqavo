The Minneapolis native was taken 23rd by the Philadelphia 76ers and traded immediately to the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><p>He joins Bill Green (Boston Celtics’ 8th pick in 1963) and Jason Smith (Miami Heat’s 20th pick in 2007) as first-round selections while becoming the 24th Ram ever selected in the draft, as well as the first since Colton Iverson was taken by the Indiana Pacers in 2013.</p><p>The fifth CSU player ever to be recognized as an All-American, Roddy was named the Mountain West Player of the Year by the league’s coaches and media in two separate polls. He set a school record for field goals made with 222, scored 595 points — which ranks third — and his 19.2 point per game scoring average is 12th all-time and third in the league in conference. Roddy finished sixth in rebounding at 7.6 and first in field goal percentage at 57.1%.</p><p>The Portland Trail Blazers selected Jabari Walker of the Unviersity of Colorado with the 57th pick of the 2022 NBA Draft. The Blazers also owned the 46th pick, as a result of a trade with the Detroit Pistons earlier this week, but they traded that to the Denver Nuggets for a second-round pick in 2024.</p><p>A native of Inglewood, Calif., Walker was a 2021-22 All-Pac-12 Conference First Team selection, averaging 14.6 points and a league-best 9.4 rebounds per game. A 6-foot-9 and 215 pound forward, Walker is Colorado’s fourth NBA Draft pick in the last six years and seventh in the 12-year Tad Boyle era.</p><p>Walker heads to a Portland team that was 27-55 in 2021-22 and 13th in the Western Conference. The Trailblazers are led by former CU All-American Chauncey Billups, who’s entering his second year as the head coach.</p><p>“It’s great that he’ll be coached by a former Buff, but he’s got to earn his roster spot, and [Walker] knows that,” Tad Boyle said. “It’s nice to have that Buff connection, but he’s going to have to play his way into the NBA.”</p><p>Overall, Walker is CU’s 36th NBA Draft pick and the second Buffs pick by Portland. Lee Haven was a ninth round pick by the Trailblazers in 1974.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6jCbr%2FTmqlmqp%2BZsbp5wq6qZq%2BRobimvoysnKWdk6mypXnIp2RraGJneq%2BuwGabq5mWqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-oliver-cromwell-related-to-thomas-cromwell-family-history.html><span>←</span><span>Was Oliver Cromwell Related to Thomas Cromwell?
