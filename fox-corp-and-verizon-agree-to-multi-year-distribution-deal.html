Similar to a live TV streaming service, such as YouTube TV or fuboTV, Fios TV delivers live television to customers over the internet.</p><p>Distribution agreements between media companies and TV providers are becoming increasingly complicated and negotiations drawn out in recent years, as the streaming wars rage on and cord-cutters affect business models. With the completion of a new pact between Fox Corp. and telco giant Verizon, Fios TV customers can be assured that their favorite Fox brands will not be leaving the service anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonp%2BteqS70alkmqaUYsOmvsizpqdlkZy%2FprGMraZmpaWhwap52J6Yq2WUnsC1vsibrK2hn6N6pbHApWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eugenia-jones.html><span>←</span><span>Eugenia Jones - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
