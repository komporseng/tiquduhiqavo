He has mainly gamed the TaylorMade M2 and TaylorMade Stealth Plus drivers.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The TaylorMade M2 Driver&nbsp; is further enhanced by a multi-material construction that combines a Speed Pocket, Geocoustic Internal Geometry, and Carbon crown. It also pairs up with a 9-degree loft set and comes spaced at 45.75 inches long, offering Woods the perfect balance of distance and forgiveness out on the course.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile, the TaylorMade Stealth Plus driver features an adjustable sole weight, a 9-degree loft, and a 45.75-inch length shaft, providing Woods with added control and distance.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Compelled Tiger Woods to Choose TaylorMade</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tiger has chosen the TaylorMade drivers because of their state-of-the-art technology, which will provide him with much longer, higher-flying, and accurate tee-balls, something he desires to compete at a high level. That includes the adjustability of Woods' new drivers, which he uses to dial in his ball flight and gain its full performance advantage when playing a course. As part of that, the brand's reputation for producing tour-proven equipment would also </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>surely</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> have weighed in Woods' decision to switch TaylorMade drivers.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Achievement and Performance-Based Contribution</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>TaylorMade played a crucial role in the success of Tiger Woods on the golf course. The forgiveness, distance, and control combo has given Woods the confidence to take on any hole design while getting his launch conditions right, which should lead to more accuracy and length from tee to green. It has helped Woods stay at the top of his game as golf becomes more and more specialized.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tailoring and customization</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tiger Woods is renowned for having a number of intricate tweaks made to his drivers over the years so that they suit him. Specifically, he has altered the sole weight and hosel settings of his TaylorMade driver to produce specific types of ball flight with a touch more draw bias with a bit of upright lie angles-stressing just how precise needs for shot shape ar</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>e becoming.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Overall, Ti</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>ger Woods' choice of drivers has fueled intense gossip and intrigue, especially given his career in the sport's hallowed halls.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mieqKSWZMSprdNmm6uhppq%2FbrDOnqpmrJmcsrN51qimnatdqsCm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jack-gilpin.html><span>←</span><span>Jack Gilpin Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
