City, which also contended for Album Of The Year. As it happens, Lamar did not win a single award last night, also losing Best New Artist to Macklemore. And that, according to Macklemore was a crime.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You got robbed. I wanted you to win. You should have,” Macklemore wrote in a text message that he sent to Lamar, screencapped and then posted to his Instagram account.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s weird and sucks that I robbed you. I was gonna say that during the speech. Then the music started playing during my speech, and I froze,” he continued. “Anyway, you know what it is. Congrats on this year and your music. Appreciate you as an artist and as a friend. Much love.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the caption to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram post</a>, Macklemore added more context: “My text to Kendrick after the show. He deserved best rap album. I’m honored and completely blown away to win anything much less 4 Grammys. But in that category, he should have won IMO, And that’s taking nothing away from The Heist. Just giving GKMC it’s proper respect.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Watch Beyonce and Jay Z Get Too Filthy For the Grammys</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>The 2014 Grammys Awards Show: Best, Worst and Inbetween</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZraWBofKi%2BwKaksqtdZ31ygIymmJyjnJq6sL7EZqqasaNiuKa6w6ugnKNdoa6urdFmrpqrXae8o67EnWSopl2XsrTAjKuYqWWRoa%2B2uY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gastly-expedition-109.html><span>←</span><span>Gastly (Expedition 109) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
