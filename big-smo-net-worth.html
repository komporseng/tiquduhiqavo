He is a singer, songwriter and producer known under the stage name Big Smo. In addition, Big Smo adds to his net worth as a film director. Big Smo became famous after the release of his studio album “Kuntry Livin’” (2014) which managed to find a place on the Billboard Top 100 chart in the USA. Big Smo has been active in the entertainment industry since 1999.</p><p>How rich is this artist? The latest estimations show that Big Smo’s net worth is as much as $3 million. The main source of his net worth is music career.</p><h3>Big Smo Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Big Smo was born to parents Carl Avery Smith, a veteran of the US Navy, and Mary Jane Smith, who now also manages him. He was raised outside of Shelbyville, Tennessee, and while studying at high school he played the drums and trumpet. In 1999, Smo took his first steps in the music industry, composing tracks and performing in a bar. His first recordings under minor recording labels started to be released in 2002, and included “Kuntry Kitchen” (2002), “The Audio Biography” (2003), “Monument Society” (2004), “The True Soft” (2007) and “American Trade” (2010). None of them appeared on the music charts, but still started his net worth to grow. Big Smo’s major label studio album entitled “Kuntry Livin’” (2014), showed up in 2014. The album contains 14 tracks and a few of them featured such performers as Alexander King, Haden Carpenter, Frankie Ballard and <a href=#>Darius Rucker</a>. The total length of the album is 47 minutes 4 seconds, and it received moderate reviews from critics though audiences loved it, and it reached 3rd place on the Rap Chart, 6th place on the Country Chart and 31st on the main music chart of the USA. These successes contributed significantly to Big Smo’s net worth.</p><p>In addition, three EPs were released, the first two of which managed to appear on the Billboard Top 100, too. “Grass Roots EP” (2012) reached the 71st position on the Country chart and “Backwoods Whiskey” (2013) 69th position on Country as well as 39th on Heartseekers chart in USA. Another charting song was “My Place” (2014) with <a href=#>Darius Rucker</a>, which appeared in 49th position of Country chart in USA.
