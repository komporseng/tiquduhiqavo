The tennis champion, who is expecting her second child with her husband <strong>Alexis Ohanian</strong>, showed off her bare baby bump as she talked about the skincare products she’s been using to keep her stomach area stretchable and free from “stretch marks,” in the clip. She was joined by her adorable daughter <strong>Olympia</strong>, 5, and the tot shouted, “Action!” at the beginning of the video, proudly serving as her mom’s director, before she started getting into her routine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Serena, who also included a preview video on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, wore a black sports bra and matching shorts under a black and white patterned silk robe as she described how she takes care of her growing stomach. Olympia rocked a white dress with multi-colored butterflies and appeared excited to be a part of the video. “I thought it would be really good for me to show you what I use on my belly,” Serena said at the beginning of the clip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She proceeded to talk about the variety of oils she uses everyday and how she didn’t use as many products when she was pregnant with Olympia. At the end of the video she cheekily said, “Maybe you wanted to know. Maybe you didn’t want to know. Maybe that was TMI.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/serena-williams-pregnant-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Serena’s latest video comes after she first announced <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she was pregnant</a> with her epic appearance at the 2023 Met Gala earlier this year. The beauty showed up to the star-studded fashion event in a black bedazzled dress that included a white bottom. She accessorized with a pearl necklace that had multiple strands as well as a pearl headpiece as her hair was pulled up in a high bun.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Serena’s second pregnancy, which was revealed after she announced her retirement from competitive tennis last year, has kept her away from the 2023 Wimbledon Tennis Championships. She was invited to the event as a spectator, but wasn’t able to travel. “She’s pregnant, so understandably couldn’t travel,” All England Club chairman&nbsp;<strong>Sally Bolton</strong>&nbsp;told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;AP News</a> on Monday, July 3. “(We) of course wish her lots of luck with the remainder of her pregnancy and we hope maybe we might see her next year.”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BvZqydopq7onnWoqOloZGiwG6uwJuwZpqlor1ursSlo7Jlk5a%2FpnnRqKytoZ6aere1w56mZqecrrqxtcBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mutual-destruction-deck-tcg.html><span>←</span><span>Mutual Destruction Deck (TCG) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
