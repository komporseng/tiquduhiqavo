Adam boughtSpeak Now and immediately put it on repeat, the only non abstract/experimental record to get such an honor, and then found his name spelled out in capital letters in “Enchanted’s” lyrics."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The whole thing is so sweet I’m gonna have to get my blood sugar checked.</p><p>Here’s what he wrote Taylor (<a href=#>Click here to hear his personalized cover of “Enchanted”</a>):</p><p>Dearest Taylor,</p><p>I’ll be the first to admit I’m a rather shy boy and since music is the most eloquent form of communication I can muster, I decided to record something for you — as sort of a “reply” to the breathtaking song on your current record. This is what I wanted so badly to tell you in person but could never quite put into words:</p><p>Everything about you is beautiful. You’re an immensely charming girl with a wonderful heart and more grace and elegance than I know how to describe. You are a true princess from a dreamy fairy tale; a modern Cinderella. I’m terribly sorry it’s taken me such a long time to reply but I figured Valentine’s Day was the perfect time to write this note to you and simply say… I was enchanted to meet you too.</p><p>Love,<br>Adam</p><p>No word yet if Taylor has responded to Adam’s grand gesture and asked him out for lattes. She might not be too impressed, because she’s recently been seen <a href=#>out and about</a> with Glee‘s Chord Overstreet.</p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRktrR505qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZJ6mk52ur8DEnWSwoaSderDDy2aaoqypqHqisMCmZLKnpaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emer-kenny.html><span>←</span><span>Emer Kenny Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married, Career, Height, Facts</span></a>
