The actress, who detests any media attention that isn't about her work, was an Oscar nominee for Best Actress.</p><p class=dh>Ana de Armas inspired a comment section full of praises this week when she posted a mesmerizing thread of black-and-white photos in her hotel room. Tagging all those who helped her prepare, the pictures depicted de Armas in a stunning spaghetti strap dress with floral and geometric designs.</p><p class=dh>Her stylist, Samantha McMillen, posted full-color photos of the actress--revealing the "stained glass" fabric of the garment--posing in a different venue. De Armas was attending the Vanity Fair Oscars Party that night.</p><p class=dh>She left her full hair down and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpz6ECdOIVW/>middle-parted</a>, with only an elaborate <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp0dDwkvUoI/>teal ring</a> to accessorize. Two days prior, de Armas <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpv0D8hoFo4/>attended the Academy</a> Awards ceremony in another custom Louis-Vuitton gown, specially made for the "Blonde" starlet, as her stylist <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpx7j_nP-7L/>explained</a>:</p><p class=dh>"This gown was very special. It took over 1000 hours to make and is completely hand-beaded. If you look closely it's like morning dew on falling rose petals…."</p><p class=dh>The day after the Academy Awards, de Armas couldn't help but express her gratitude to the people who ensured she was breathtaking on a momentous evening. She shared an appreciation post for her beauty team, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpyIYaCuOFE/>referring to them</a> as her "team of unicorns that helped me dance my way onto my first Oscars carpet. THANK YOU!" she wrote.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>As an Actress, Ana de Armas Faced Struggles in Finding Privacy for Herself</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>De Armas' career, fully supported <a class="me a" href=#>by her parents</a>, began in Spain. She gained fame as a film and TV star in the country and became accustomed to the unwanted attention of the paparazzi. However, it was somewhat exacerbated when she came to the U.S.</p><p class=dh>De Armas was in a relationship with <a class="me a" href=#>Ben Affleck</a>—now married to <a class="me a" href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>—which ended in early 2021; however, the former couple struggled to even enjoy walks on the beach without the incessant presence of invasive photographers.</p><p class=dh>De Armas never wanted any <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://variety.com/2022/awards/features/ana-de-armas-marilyn-monroe-blonde-netflix-1235377948/>public attention</a>, especially on <a class="me a" href=#>her love life</a>, if it wasn't about her work; she found it upsetting and, more so, frightening. She noted how there's little protection for celebrities from paparazzi photographers who lack restraint and respect for privacy.</p><p class=dh>Still, it was her experience with them that helped her connect with her character, Marilyn Monroe, in "Blonde." Her most recent and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/02/ana-de-armas-hollywood-issue-2023>upcoming project</a> is the "John Wick" spin-off film "Ballerina." Though her primary vocation has been acting, de Armas is also looking to work behind the scenes and produce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1namhnbnqiusBmm55lkae6or%2BMqaytq12YwrPCxKxkmqaUYrmms4yopWegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-fastest-ko-in-ufc-history.html><span>←</span><span>What is the Fastest KO in UFC History?</span></a>
