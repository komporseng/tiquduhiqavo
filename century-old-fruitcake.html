No one likes the person who brings a fruitcake to the Christmas party.
But what if it was a perfectly preserved 106-year-old fruitcake?
I can’t decide if it would make it better or worse, but conservationists from the Antarctic Heritage Trust now have that option.
They recently discovered what they approximate to be a 106-year-old fruitcake, left wrapped in paper, inside a metal tin, on a shelf, inside a Cape Adare hut that was used by explorer Robert Falcon Scott’s crew in 1911."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
