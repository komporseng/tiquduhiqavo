He is best known for his work with Journey, Bad English, and as a solo artist in contemporary Christian music.</p><p>With Journey, Cain wrote the hit song “Faithfully” and co-wrote other popular songs like “Don’t Stop Believin’,” “Open Arms,” and “Who’s Crying Now.” He plays keyboards, rhythm guitar, and harmonica for the band and also contributes lead and backing vocals.</p><p>Journey has released 15 studio albums, including the Diamond album “Escape” (1981) and the 6× Platinum “Frontiers” (1983). Their song “Don’t Stop Believin'” is the highest-selling digital track of the 20th century and was recently preserved in the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry for its cultural significance.</p><p>Cain has released several solo albums, including “Windy City Breakdown” (1977), “For a Lifetime” (1998), “Bare Bones” (2004), and “More Like Jesus” (2019). In 2018, he published a memoir called “Don’t Stop Believin’: The Man, the Band, and the Song that Inspired Generations.”</p><p>In 2017, Cain and his fellow members of Journey were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Musical_Beginnings>Early Life and Musical Beginnings</span></h2><p>Jonathan Cain, born Jonathan Leonard Friga on February 26, 1950, in Chicago, grew up in a religious household with his parents and two younger brothers. He attended Our Lady of the Angels Catholic school where he survived a fire that killed three nuns and over 90 students. This tragedy pushed him away from religion, but his father encouraged his musical talent and shifted his focus to music. Cain began taking accordion lessons at the age of 8 and eventually learned to play piano, bass, guitar, and harmonica. He graduated from East Leyden High School in 1968 and went on to attend the Chicago Conservatory of Music.</p><h2><span id=Jonathan_Cains_Music_Career>Jonathan Cain’s Music Career</span></h2><p>Jonathan Cain began his music career in 1976, releasing his debut album “Windy City Breakdown” under the name the Jonathan Cain Band. He later joined the Babys in 1979, performing on their albums “Union Jacks” and “On the Edge” in 1980.</p><p>In the same year, Cain left the Babys to join Journey as their new keyboardist, replacing Gregg Rolie. His first album with the band was “Escape” in 1981, which was a massive success, achieving Diamond certification. Cain was responsible for creating one of the most iconic opening keyboard riffs in rock history on the hit song “Don’t Stop Believin’.”</p><p>Journey’s peak success came with lead singer Steve Perry, but the band has since been led by Arnel Pineda.</p><h2><span id=Bad_English_and_Jimmy_Barnes>Bad English and Jimmy Barnes</span></h2><p>Jonathan Cain wrote and produced the 1985 hit song “Working Class Man” for Jimmy Barnes. In 1987, Cain formed Bad English with Ricky Phillips, John Waite, Neal Schon, and Deen Castronovo. The band released a Platinum self-titled album in 1989, followed by “Backlash” in 1991. Their single “When I See You Smile” reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1989.</p><h2><span id=Journeys_Post-Hiatus_Success>Journey’s Post-Hiatus Success</span></h2><p>Journey went on hiatus in 1987 and reunited in 1995. Since then, they have released seven albums, sold over 80 million records, and continued to tour extensively.</p><p>Keyboardist Jonathan Cain has been an integral part of Journey since joining the band in 1980. At every concert, he performs a piano solo, usually preceding the band’s hit song “Open Arms.”</p><p>Some of Journey’s most successful post-hiatus albums include “Trial by Fire” (1996), “Revelation” (2008), and “Freedom” (2022).</p><h2><span id=Jonathan_Cains_Recent_Focus_on_Christian_Music_and_Speaking_Engagements>Jonathan Cain’s Recent Focus on Christian Music and Speaking Engagements</span></h2><p>Since 2016, Jonathan Cain has primarily focused on Christian music and has performed on albums by his Journey bandmate Neal Schon. He has also become a sought-after speaker, giving speeches at events such as the Better Man Event and Prestonwood Men’s Conference. In recent years, Cain has performed at the National Day of Prayer, Creation Music Festival, and NCAA Final Four tournament. Jonathan hosts the Anchored Podcast, where he shares from the heart on topics of faith, family, marriage, manhood, and music.</p><p>In 2022, Cain released his solo album “Arise.” However, in 2020, Cain and Schon fired two members of Journey, Ross Valory and Steve Smith, and sued them for more than $10 million. They alleged that the men had engaged in an attempted corporate coup d’état to gain control of Nightmare Productions, which they believed was in control of the Journey name and logo. Valory countersued for emotional distress and breach of contract. Ultimately, all parties resolved their differences and reached an amicable settlement agreement.</p><h2><span id=Jonathan_Cains_Personal_Life_and_Philanthropy>Jonathan Cain’s Personal Life and Philanthropy</span></h2><p>Jonathan Cain married Tané McClure in 1980, and they divorced in 1984.
