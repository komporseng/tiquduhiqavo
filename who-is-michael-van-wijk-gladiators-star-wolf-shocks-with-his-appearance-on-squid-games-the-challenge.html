Some of the challenges in the games are almost the same as that of the original show.</p><p>The first challenge was "red light green light." It showed the contestants running towards the red line in order to move ahead in the show.</p><p>However, the show took a turn when the "tug of war" challenge was replaced by the "warship" challenge. As the program progressed, numerous contestants were eliminated from the game.</p><p>Towards the end, we will see only a few contestants remaining, who will then fight physically as well as emotionally to win the game and the huge prize money. With the elimination of each contestant, $100K money is added to the winning prize.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Will there be 'Squid Games: The Challenge' Season 2?</h2><p>As of now, there has been no announcement regarding Season 2 of 'Squid Games: The Challenge.'
