While he lives in England, his wife divides her time between Manchester and Bilbao, her homeland. Aymeric Laporte is a professional Spanish soccer player who plays left defender for the Spanish national team.&nbsp;Laporte, who was born in Agen, France, to a Basque family, first represented France in multiple competitions for different age categories before electing to play for Spain.

He also won five Premier League championships and a UEFA Champions League with Manchester City.</p><h2>Who Is Aymeric’s Wife’s Sara Botello?</h2><p><strong>Aymeric Laporte</strong>, a Spanish soccer defender, is married to his long-term lover, Sara Botello. After years of courting, the couple married on June 25, 2023. The French-born renowned athlete first visited Spain in 2010. When Aymeric first met Sara Botello in 2016, he was already a main defender for Atletico Bilbao. Sara, a soccer fan from Bilbao, recognized Aymeric and was instantly taken with him when he approached her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Aymeric-Laporte-1.jpg><p>Sara Botello, who was born and reared in Bilbao, is a trained dancer who specializes in ballet and modern dance.&nbsp;She formerly worked as a cheerleader for the basketball team Bilbao Basket, in addition to performing in dance exhibitions in her hometown.&nbsp;Laporte and Sara were upfront about their relationship and posted images of themselves on social media.</p><p>After almost six years of marriage, the couple had their first child, Lucay, in August 2022.&nbsp;Aymeric later announced his arrival on Instagram, writing, “There’s a new Cityzen in town: LUCAY, Mom, dad, and baby are all doing well, we are both very proud and thankful for this incredible moment.” Thank you for your kind words.”</p><h2>Laporte’s Younger Brother Is a Professional Soccer Player as Well</h2><p><strong>Aymeric Laporte</strong> was born on May 27, 1994, to Lionel and Agnes Laporte.
