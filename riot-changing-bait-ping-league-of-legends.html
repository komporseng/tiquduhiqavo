It all started with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 12.22</a> when a bunch of changes were introduced to the game. The key changes are additions like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartsteel</a>, the reintroduction of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rod of Ages</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">jungle changes</a>, and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new ping wheel</a>.</p><p>As time passed, Riot made a lot of amendments and new updates to the game. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 12.22B</a> fixed a lot of the issues Patch 12.22 introduced, while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 12.23</a> was the next off-season update. While those were significant changes, Riot has not touched its new communication system since Patch 12.22.</p><p>This brings us back to the new ping wheel that Riot introduced to League of Legends. Many of the new pings like Bait, Push, All-In, and Hold. Most of the pings are working as intended, barring the Bait ping. Thus, the PBE assets show that the Bait ping is being changed. Here is what we know so far.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All League of Legends Xbox Game Pass Rewards</a></p><h2 id=the-controversy-with-the-bait-ping class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">The Controversy With The Bait Ping</h2><p>As soon as the Bait Ping was released, social media was flooded with quite the remarks. While Riot intended for the ping to be used as a strategic tool, players had other ideas. They started using it to ping teammates and use it as a way to agitate teammates. The whole noise and look of the ping have now been darkened by its current use for players.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>are we going to rework the bait ping or just leave it? i can’t use it without somebody thinking i’m telling them to go die and then flaming me and leaving the game <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yZu32WoKes</a></p>— Drew (@Midbeast) <a href=#>December 9, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"></figure><h2 id=what-is-riot-changing-the-bait-ping-to class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">What Is Riot Changing The Bait Ping To?</h2><p>According to the PBE assets revealed by HANCOCK on Twitter, we now know what the new Bait Ping will look like.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Contrasting to the current bait ping, it just looks like a titled fish hook with a leaf/wing icon on the side of it. However, this will not change the issue with the ping. While Riot meant well by introducing the ping, the community has not used it in the best way possible.</p><p>The slight alteration, while it looks good, is not going to fix the issue. The only way to do that would be to redo the appearance and go in a different direction entirely. However, that is unlikely, so the new version is what we will get soon. Hopefully, the ping will be used properly so that Riot’s vision can be achieved with the new ping wheel in League of Legends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaKys7XVZ5qopV%2BntrDAjJyfmqaXnruoecGaoK1loJ67qHnLnpigrZVivKd5y56enqaUqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lebron-james-reportedly-looking-to-play-another-2-3-years.html><span>←</span><span>Lebron James Reportedly Looking to Play Another 2-3 Years</span></a>
